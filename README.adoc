= LPT Capture

Capture parallel printer output to a file, via a suitable client such as CuteCom, than convert that to a LibreOffice text file.

This consists of hardware/firmware in src and PC, Linux, software in pcsrc.

First build your device using the schematic.
I used perf board and wires since the wiring is very simple.  Resistor values are 1K but other values around this may work too.
No resistors at all will work but may expose your parallel port to currents it can's handle.
There should probably be voltage spike protection to with suitable diodes.
